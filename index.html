                    We are a small technology team based in Azerbaijan, members from various countries around the world. We make projects, concepts, and designs for the future of 0xFF Technology company.<br><br>

                    Our goal is to make tech fair again and bring what you loved to you by actually listening to our community, treating them like a part of our team, valuing their wants and needs.<br><br>

                    The name 0xFF has different meanings, such as “Zero exploit full force”, “Turned all the way up”, or just a fun name based on hexadecimal terms.<br><br>

                    The logo, which looks aesthetically pleasing to some, or weird to others, also carries different meanings: The main state of the logo, which resembles a mouse cursor, represents technology, software, and similar stuff; If you rotate the logo clockwise approximately 30 degrees, the logo resembles an arrow that represents progress and future; And lastly if you rotate the logo approximately 150 degrees clockwise, the logo resembles a heart meaning love, care, friendship, and trust.<br><br>

                    Our unique Metallic Glass design language is one of our biggest differences. It uses Metallic shading, Glassy transparency and shine, Hexagonal shapes, and some unique features such as the our custom made HexaFont font which originally was made for the logo. Our Metallic Glass design language is inspired by Dark Aero, Frutiger Aero, Apple’s Liquid Glass, and Nothing’s custom design language. It is made to make the interface you are interacting with feel detailed, nostalgic, realistic, alive, solid, rigid, and modern.<br><br>

                    We still are beginning, and we are financially weak but we are aiming to grow into a fully established company in the future. The idea of 0xFF Technology was made in mid 2025 by an anonymous internet user called Mr.Kotlet.<br><br>

                    Since we are just in the beginning, things are hard for us. But you can financially help us by donating or directly helping us by joining our team.<br><br>

                    Thanks for taking your time to read! We hope that we can do the best for you!<br>
